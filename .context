## Blog System

### Overview
The blog system provides a platform to share insights on image analysis, biophysics, and data science. All blog posts are published in both English and Spanish with a chronological list view (newest posts displayed first).

### Blog Pages
- **`blog-en.html`** - English blog listing page with all blog posts in reverse chronological order
- **`blog-es.html`** - Spanish blog listing page ("Blog" header, navigation in Spanish, reverse chronological order)
- Both pages include:
  - Language selector (EN/ES links)
  - Post listing with date, title, excerpt, and "Read More" link
  - Post dates displayed in highlighted date boxes (day/month year format)
  - Responsive layout using Bootstrap grid
  - Integration with site header, navigation, and footer

### Blog Posts Organization

#### File Naming Convention
All blog post files follow the pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD-post-slug-{en|es}.html`
- `YYYY-MM-DD` - Publication date in ISO format (e.g., 2026-02-22)
- `post-slug` - URL-friendly slug (lowercase, hyphens between words, no spaces)
- `{en|es}` - Language suffix (en for English, es for Spanish)

**Examples:**
- `2026-02-22-welcome-en.html` (English post)
- `2026-02-22-welcome-es.html` (Spanish equivalent)
- `2026-02-22-scientific-romantic-en.html` (English post with multi-word slug)
- `2026-02-22-cientifico-romatico.html` (Spanish equivalent)

#### File Location
All blog posts are stored in: `blog-posts/` directory

#### Directory Structure
- `blog-post-template-en.html` - English template
- `blog-post-template-es.html` - Spanish template
- `2026-02-22-welcome-en.html` - English blog post example
- `2026-02-22-welcome-es.html` - Spanish blog post example
- `2026-02-22-scientific-romantic-en.html` - Another English blog post
- `2026-02-22-cientifico-romatico.html` - Spanish equivalent

### Creating New Blog Posts

#### Step 1: Copy the Template
1. Copy `blog-post-template-en.html` (for English) or `blog-post-template-es.html` (for Spanish)
2. Rename following the naming convention: `YYYY-MM-DD-post-slug-{en|es}.html`

#### Step 2: Update Post Metadata
In the `<head>` section:
- Update `<title>` to: "Post Title - Agustin Corbat"
- Update `<meta name="description">` with a brief description
- Update `<meta name="keywords">` with relevant keywords

#### Step 3: Update Post Content
In the breadcrumbs section:
- Update the `<h2>Blog Post</h2>` to the actual post title (optional)
- Update language links to point to corresponding language version:
  ```html
  <a href="YYYY-MM-DD-post-slug-en.html" class="lang-link active">EN</a>
  <a href="YYYY-MM-DD-post-slug-es.html" class="lang-link">ES</a>
  ```
- Update breadcrumb final item with post title

In the post header:
- Update `<h1 class="post-title">` with actual title
- Update `<span class="post-date">` with publication date (format: "Month DD, YYYY")

In the post content:
- Replace all template content with actual blog post content
- Use semantic HTML: `<h2>` for main sections, `<h3>` for subsections, `<p>` for paragraphs
- Include images if needed (stored in `assets/img/blog/` directory)
- Uncomment and update featured image section if using one

#### Step 4: Create Language Pair
For every English post created, also create a Spanish equivalent:
- Copy the newly created English post
- Translate the `<title>`, metadata, and post content
- Update language links to match

### Updating Blog List Pages

#### Adding Posts to Blog Lists
When a new blog post is created, it must be added to both `blog-en.html` and `blog-es.html`:

**In `blog-en.html` and `blog-es.html`:**
1. Add new post at the top of the blog list (newest posts first)
2. Use the template comment provided in the file:
   ```html
   <article class="blog-post-item" data-aos="fade-up">
     <div class="row">
       <div class="col-md-2">
         <div class="post-date">
           <span class="day">DD</span>
           <span class="month">MMM YYYY</span>
         </div>
       </div>
       <div class="col-md-10">
         <h3 class="post-title">
           <a href="blog-posts/YYYY-MM-DD-post-slug-en.html">Post Title</a>
         </h3>
         <p class="post-excerpt">
           Brief description of the post content...
         </p>
         <a href="blog-posts/YYYY-MM-DD-post-slug-en.html" class="read-more">Read More <i class="bi bi-arrow-right"></i></a>
       </div>
     </div>
   </article>
   <hr style="margin: 2rem 0; opacity: 0.1;">
   ```

3. For Spanish posts in `blog-es.html`, update language and links accordingly

#### Chronological Order Requirement
- **IMPORTANT**: New posts must always be placed at the TOP of the blog list (before existing posts)
- This ensures newest content appears first
- Add `<hr>` separator between posts for visual separation

### Blog Post Template Structure

Both templates (`blog-post-template-en.html` and `blog-post-template-es.html`) include:

1. **HTML Head**
   - Meta tags for responsiveness, character encoding, description, keywords
   - Asset links with `../` relative paths (for blog-posts subfolder)
   - Compatible CSS/JS vendors

2. **Header Navigation**
   - Profile section with image and social links
   - Navigation menu with all site sections
   - Links use `../` prefix for parent directory access

3. **Breadcrumb Navigation**
   - Shows: Home > Blog > Post Title
   - Language selector for switching between EN/ES versions

4. **Blog Post Content Section**
   - Post header with title and metadata (date, author)
   - Optional featured image section
   - Post content area with full article text
   - Semantic HTML structure

5. **Footer**
   - Copyright and credits
   - Back-to-top button

6. **Scripts and Styling**
   - All vendor JavaScript loaded from `../assets/vendor/`
   - Main stylesheet from `../assets/css/style.css`
   - Bootstrap framework for responsive layout

### CSS Styling for Blog
Blog-specific CSS is included in each page:
- `.blog-post-item` - Individual post container styling
- `.post-date` - Date box styling (blue background, centered)
- `.post-title` - Post title styling with link
- `.post-excerpt` - Brief post description
- `.post-date .day` - Large day number (2rem font)
- `.post-date .month` - Month/year text (0.9rem font)
- `.read-more` - Link styling for "Read More" button

### Best Practices

1. **Naming Consistency**
   - Always use lowercase hyphens in slugs
   - Use ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD)
   - End with language suffix (-en or -es)

2. **Content Organization**
   - Write clear, descriptive excerpts for blog lists (2-3 sentences)
   - Use logical heading structure (h1 for title, h2/h3 for sections)
   - Keep posts scannable with subheadings and bullet points
   - Add images from `assets/img/blog/` directory when relevant

3. **Translation**
   - Create both language versions before publishing
   - Translate slugs appropriately (not just copy English slug)
   - Ensure both language versions link to each other
   - Keep dates consistent across language versions

4. **List Maintenance**
   - Always add new posts to the top of blog lists
   - Remove `<hr>` separator from the last post if needed
   - Verify all links work (relative paths are correct)
   - Check language selectors point to correct versions

5. **Publishing Workflow**
   1. Create English post file with translated slug
   2. Create Spanish post file with translated slug
   3. Add both to `blog-en.html` at the top
   4. Add both to `blog-es.html` at the top (in reverse, Spanish version first as it's the active language)
   5. Test navigation and language switching
   6. Commit to Git with descriptive message
