Career Statement:
  free_text:
  - My focus is set on the design of experiments and simulations to adequately describe
    and evaluate how information flows through a biological network in order to make
    quantitative predictions. My education is oriented to biophysics, model simulations
    and microscopy. Currently, I am working as a bioimage analyst at Universidad de
    Buenos Aires, Argentina.
  - '**Interdisciplinary Image Analyst** with a PhD in Physics and core training in
    Medicine. My work focuses on translating complex data from diverse medical imaging
    modalities (**Microscopy, MRI, CT, Digital Pathology**) into actionable insights
    using both classical image processing and modern advanced **deep learning** techniques.
    I possess hands-on experience in frameworks like **PyTorch** and a solid theoretical
    understanding of **CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, and GenAI**. I drive diverse academic
    and industry research projects by designing bespoke **image analysis workflows**,
    **providing expert consultation**, and disseminating knowledge through **teaching**.'
